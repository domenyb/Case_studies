I have found some simulated google analytics data in my old files. 

I'm not sure where it is from - I assume this is one of my first attempts at playing with data outside of physics&astronomy - but I also had 700+ lines of semi-commented python code with it in which I explored the basic properties, and a pdf detailing my findings. 

Now I have spent a day to polish both (and to move most of the python code into a notebook for better readability), since I think the essence of my thinking is still the same and can be represented by this notebook - even if the code is no longer up to my highest standards.
